Vagrant-Mono-Nginx
==================

This project contains everything necessary to set up a Vagrant box running an ASP.NET web server on Ubuntu, using Mono, Nginx and FastCGI Mono. It uses a package generated by the [vagrant-mono](https://github.com/chilimangoes/vagrant-mono) repository as a base box.

**Important note**: The `./build-support/server-files/init.d/monoserve` file needs to have Unix-style line endings, otherwise you will get a cryptic `: File does not exist` error when trying to start up the FastCGI Mono server. If you're running Windows and have GIT configured to automatically manage text file line endings (their default recommended setting on Windows), GIT will change the line endings on this file to Windows-style CR/LF when you clone the repository, resulting in the aforementioned error when the file is copied to your Vagrant box running Linux. I personally find this setting to be more trouble than it's worth and prefer to manage my own line endings because any reasonably good IDE or text editor understands Unix-style line endings. To turn off this setting, run the follwing command from the command prompt (eg, by running GIT Bash if you have GIT for Windows installed).

```
	git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

Prerequisites:
==============

1. Install VirtualBox - NOTE: If you are running on Windows 8 please make sure not to install the network drivers, as explained in this post: [http://www.grumpydev.com/2013/06/19/windows-8-hyper-v-virtualbox-vagrant-and-hanging-on-boot/](http://www.grumpydev.com/2013/06/19/windows-8-hyper-v-virtualbox-vagrant-and-hanging-on-boot/)
2. Install Vagrant from [http://www.vagrantup.com/](http://www.vagrantup.com/)
3. Install the vagrant-mountcommand plugin for Vagrant by running `vagrant plugin install vagrant-mountcommand`. This is to work around a current limitation with running commands at boot time that need to run *after* Vagrant mounts the /vagrant shared folder. See [here](https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/2310) for more details.
4. Download the [vagrant-mono](https://github.com/chilimangoes/vagrant-mono) box and follow the instructions for building and packaging it.
